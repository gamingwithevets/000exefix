# Backstory
On May 11, 2015, YouTuber [FlyTech Videos](youtube.com/FlyTechVideos) posted a [creepypasta video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHlvjC6yOtM) of **000.exe**, a computer virus. The video gained a lot of attention that FlyTech decides to release it publicly for users to try out.
## FlyTech's policy
In his [000.exe Making Of video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_TYnADDsLQ), FlyTech writes:

> **Warning:**
> This is not a joke program, it will modify the Windows registry and delete some files.  
> <ins>DO NOT</ins> SEND IT TO ANYONE AS A JOKE.  
> <ins>DO NOT</ins> LAUNCH IT ON YOUR MAIN SYSTEM.  
> IF YOU WANT TO TRY IT OUT, USE A <ins>VIRTUAL MACHINE</ins>.

Unfortunately, some users didn't see this warning and therefore still said it was a prank. This is the case with [a user who answered a question on Quora about 000.exe](https://qr.ae/pGLpAt). This user also said the virus is harmless, when it's not. *(Please **do not** accuse this user for saying misleading information!)*

So! Have **you** ever been infected with 000.exe? Do you wanna remove that virus from your computer, but don't wanna do all that registry editing?  
Don't worry, because **GWE's 000.exe Virus Removal Tool** has got you covered!  
It can remove 000.exe without *any* work!... Well, not really.

# How to use
Upon running the script, if a prompt appears, select Yes, as administrator permissions **are required** for the program.  
The program will diagnose your computer first to determine if your computer is infected with 000.exe or not.  
After that, you will be brought to the menu, where you can back up stuff that 000.exe can delete.  
If you are infected, you have the option to attempt to remove the virus, where the program uses the backups that were created before the infection.

# FAQ
**Q: What is the "WindowsApps" folder?**  
A: The WindowsApps folder is a folder found hidden in the Program Files folder and can't be opened normally. It is present in Windows 8 and onward. It holds all the preinstalled software and also contains the applications you installed from the Microsoft Store.

**Q: I got infected and deleted all the UR NEXT files and the OPENME file on my desktop. The program sees the desktop as "deleted", but some of my desktop's files are still there. Why is that?**  
A: That's because those icons come from the *Public* desktop, which files will appear in every single user's desktop. The other files that were deleted by the virus come from *your own* desktop.

**Q: I found a bug in the program! Where can I report it?**  
A: You can report a bug or glitch in the program [here](https://github.com/gamingwithevets/000exefix/issues).
